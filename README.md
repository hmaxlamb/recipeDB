## Recipe.DB ##

This is a personal project where I take cooking to the command line. 
Since real engineers dont use any GUIs, yet they still need to eat, there
must be a tool to keep recipes in. Delivary apps have slow and invasive GUIs
and books can not be backed up, so this tool has been created.

## Whats used in the app ##

This application is a fairly simple python app that uses a sqlite database for 
persistant storage. Other databases are kinda overkill and this one works pretty well.

## How to use ##
